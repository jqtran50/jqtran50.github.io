								Arthur (UCLA ‘16) is an avid blogger and aspiring academic who served as Blogging Editor at the Daily Bruin, UCLA’s student-run newspaper. The other highlight of his undergraduate career was teaching a class at UCLA in the spring quarter through a program called USIE. He is currently figuring out which one of these activities he likes more.

								Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

								Jimmy (UC Berkeley ‘18) is a first-generation Vietnamese American student whose first exposure to the community college system was in the eighth grade, so to say that he understands CC is an understatement. He enjoys reading ASSIST, reading current events, and biking on his free time. His sights are set on law school.
